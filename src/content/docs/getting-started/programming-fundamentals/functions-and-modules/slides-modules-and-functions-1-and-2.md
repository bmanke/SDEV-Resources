## Introduction to Functions and Modular Code

### What is a function.

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code into logical sections, making it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
Analogy: Think of a function as a tool in a toolbox. Each tool (function) has a specific purpose, and you can use it whenever you need to perform that task.

### Why use functions?

- As programs grow, organizing code into functions makes it easier to read, maintain, and debug.
- Functions let you break your code into reusable, logical pieces.
- This is in every programming language and is a fundamental concept in programming.

## Defining a Function

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. You define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.

Analogy: Think of a function as a recipe. You define the steps (code) to make a dish (task), and you can use that recipe whenever you want to make that dish.

```python
# function definition
def greet_user():
    print("Hello, welcome to the program!")

# function call
greet_user()
```
Notes on the above example
- Use `def` to define a function, you can name a function anything you want (as long as it follows Python's naming rules). Here we named it `greet_user`.
- Call the function by its name followed by parentheses.

---

## Functions with Parameters

Functions can take inputs called parameters, allowing you to pass data into the function.
- Note parameters are defined in the function definition, and you provide values (arguments) when calling the function.

Analogy: Think of parameters as ingredients in a recipe. You can change the ingredients to make different versions of the dish. For example a pizza recipe can take different toppings as parameters.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b): # a and b are parameters
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 7) # 3 and 7 are arguments
print("Sum:", result)
```

Here, `a` and `b` are parameters. When we call `add_numbers(3, 7)`, it passes the values 3 and 7 to the function, which then returns their sum.

---

## Returning Values

The `return` statement sends a value back to the caller.

Analogy: Think of a function as a machine that processes inputs and gives you an output.

```python
def get_favorite_color():
    color = input("What's your favorite color? ")
    return color

user_color = get_favorite_color()
print("You like", user_color)
```

Here the variable `color` only exists with in the function scope, but we can `return` it to use outside the function. So when we call `get_favorite_color()`, it returns the user's input which we can store in `user_color`.

---

## Organizing Code with Functions

Functions help separate concerns and make code easier to test and reuse.

Example
```python
def get_temperature():
    return float(input("Enter the temperature: "))

def is_hot(temp):
    return temp > 30

temp = get_temperature()
if is_hot(temp):
    print("It's a hot day!")
else:
    print("It's not too hot.")
```

---

## The Main Guard

Code under `if __name__ == "__main__":` only runs when the file is executed directly, not when imported.
- For example if the file is named `example.py` and you run it directly with `python example.py` in the terminal, the code under the main guard will execute.

Example
```python
def main():
    print("This code runs when the script is executed directly.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

You'll be using this pattern to ensure that your code runs correctly whether it's imported as a module or run as a script.

---

## Default Parameter Values

You can provide default values for parameters, making them optional.

```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    return base ** exponent

print(power(3))      # 9 (3 squared)
print(power(2, 3))   # 8 (2 cubed)
```

Note on the above example:
- If you don’t provide a value, the default is used.
    - so in the first call `power(3)`, the `exponent` defaults to 2.
    - In the second call `power(2, 3)`, you override the default by providing a value for `exponent`.

---

## Keyword Arguments

You can specify arguments by name, making your code clearer.

```python
def describe_pet(animal, name):
    print(f"I have a {animal} named {name}.")

describe_pet(animal="dog", name="Buddy")
describe_pet(name="Whiskers", animal="cat")
```

- Keyword arguments can be given in any order.

Important Note: You always have to order your keyword arguments after positional arguments, so if you have a function that takes both positional and keyword arguments, the positional arguments must come first.
- We we'll see this a lot more as we program more complex functions.

---

## Importing Functions from Other Files

You can organize your code by putting functions in separate files (modules) and importing them.

Suppose you have a file `math_utils.py`:

```python
def square(n):
    return n * n
```

You can use it in another file:

```python
from math_utils import square

print(square(6))  # 36
```

We'll talk more about modules and how to set up a project structure later, but for now, this is how you can import functions from other files.
- There's more to importing than just this, but this is a good start to conceptualize how to use functions from other files.

---

## Summary

- Functions make your code modular, readable, and reusable.
- Use functions to break up tasks, accept arguments, and return results.
- The main guard helps control script execution and importing.
- Functions with parameters are powerful and flexible.
- Use multiple, default, and keyword arguments to make your functions easy to use.
- Organize your code by importing functions from other files (modules).
